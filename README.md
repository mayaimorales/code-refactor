## Description

In this project, I was provided with code for a working webpage for a company called "Horiseon" that specializes in Search Engine Optimization. The code had room for improvement with semantic HTML elements to be added and to ensure better overall accessibility. I wanted to make sure to the best of my ability that I could accomplish these objectives.

## What Was Done

When examining the code initially, I saw there were a lot of <div> tags indicating seperation in the page but not clear as to what was happening. I replaced these tags with more specific elements like `<header>`, `<h1>`, `<body>`, and `<section>` to ensure clarity on what each part of the code was intended for. This was done throughout the index.html document.

Throughout my code refactoring, I added comments to the lines that I edited so that the next user could better understand what was done to the code and what my intentions were behind changing the original code.

## Accomplished Objectives

With the help of research, I found that accessibility is broken down into 4 standards:
- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

With the utilization of more semantic HTML elements, comments, and other needed attributes throughout the code, the accessibility objective was met making the interpreting of the code much easier to other users.
